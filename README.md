# Aura.Project_Kernel

Unlike Aura library packages, this Kernel package is *not* intended for
independent use. It exists as a base for [Aura.Cli_Kernel][],
[Aura.Web_Kernel][], and other future project kernels.

To run the integration tests, change to the `tests/kernel/` directory and issue `./phpunit.sh`.
